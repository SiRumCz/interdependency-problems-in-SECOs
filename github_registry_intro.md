## GitHub Package Registry
In 2019 May 10th, GitHub announced GitHub Package Registry, a package management service that helps to publish public and private packages. From the introduction, the Registry also supports other existing package management tools such as npm, Maven, RubuGems, NuGet, etc.

The goal of this Registry that GitHub claimed is to bring developers(dependences) close to the source code from the platform where the project is hosted on and collaboration taken place. In this way, it helps to gain trust, understand code, and connect with the contributor community.

This section will be talking about what are people's opinions on new GitHub Package Registry.

### Concern of GitHub being the central of open source community

>Maybe I am in the minority here, but I am concerned that the free or open source community (whatever you want to call it) is becoming too centralized around GitHub. I'm not a fan of the majority of FOSS software projects depending on one repository host, especially one that is ironically proprietary. I would prefer movements towards decentralization (federation a la ActivityPub and the growth of libre competitors to GitHub), and widespread adoption of GitHub's package registry would be in the opposite direction of what I hope for.
