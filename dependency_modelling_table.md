### Dependency modelling table for 5 software ecosystems

**Maven**: an Apache software used for software project management and comprehension tool based on the concept of project object model(POM). https://maven.apache.org/ <br>
**NPM**: a node package management tool for Node.js runtime environment for JavaScript web applicaiton services. NPM registry currently hosts over 1,000,000 packages with 11,000,000,000 weekly and 49,000,000,000 monthly downloads. https://www.npmjs.com/ <br>
**CRAN**: the Comprehensive R Archive Network that stores identical, up-to-date, versions of code and documentation for R. https://cran.r-project.org/ <br>
**dpkg**: a package manager for Debian-based systems. http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dpkg.1.html <br>
**Cargo**: a package manager for Rust programming language. Rust is a modern system-level programming language. I expect to see Rust community carry out the best practices in dependency management given the fact it is a young and trending platform. https://crates.io/ <br>
